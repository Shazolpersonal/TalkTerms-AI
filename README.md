## 4. Development Roadmap

*   **Phase 1: Foundation & Landing Page**
    *   **Task 1.1 - 1.9:** All tasks are **(✓ Completed)**.

*   **Phase 2: Authentication, Dashboard & Refinement (Current Focus)**
    *   **Task 2.1 - 2.5:** Initial Auth & Dashboard setup. **(✓ Completed)**
    *   **Task 2.6: Consolidate Authentication Flow:**
        *   In the `Navbar`, merge the "Login" and "Sign Up" buttons into a single, primary action button labeled **"Get Started"**.
        *   This "Get Started" button will now be the main entry point for new and returning users, directly initiating the Google sign-up/login process.
    *   **Task 2.7: Refine Dashboard UI/UX:**
        *   Remove all redundant elements. Specifically, the `Navbar` should be the single source for user info and logout, so remove the duplicate "Welcome, [Name]!" message and the second "Logout" button from the main dashboard body.
        *   The dashboard body should be clean, focusing only on the primary action: "Start Your First Negotiation".
    *   **Task 2.8: Activate the "Glimpse" Button:**
        *   Make the "Get Your Glimpse" button on the `LandingPage` functional.
        *   When clicked, it should smoothly scroll the user down to the "Glimpse of the Power" section of the page.

*   **Phase 3: Core AI Functionality**
    *   *(Tasks to be defined)*
