## 1. Vibe & Philosophy
*   **Core Vibe:** Empowering, Confident, Trustworthy, Calm.
*   **Design Philosophy:** "Dynamic Serenity". A key principle of this is **Clarity and Discoverability**. All interactive elements must be clearly visible and distinguishable from non-interactive elements in their default state.

## 2. Technical Architecture
*   *(Unchanged)*

## 3. Core Design System
*   **Primary Color (Action Blue):** `#4A90E2`
*   **Text Color (Primary):** `#1F2937` (High Contrast)
*   **Button Hierarchy:**
    *   **Primary CTA:** Solid background (`#4A90E2`) with white text.
    *   **Secondary/Outline Buttons:** Transparent background with a strong border and text color (`#1F2937`) for high visibility.

    *   **Task 1.1 - 1.8:** Initial Setup, Page Construction & Polish. **(âœ“ Completed)**
    *   **Task 1.9 (Current Focus): Final Polish & Critical Bug Fixing.** This task addresses critical UI/UX issues to finalize the landing page for a professional launch.
        *   **1.9.1: Fix Structural Duplication:** Remove the duplicate `Navbar` component at the top and the duplicate footer text at the bottom of the page.
        *   **1.9.2: Implement Button Hierarchy:** Correct the color and contrast of all buttons. The primary CTA must be solid blue. All secondary/outline buttons (like 'Login' and the 'Glimpse' tabs) must have a clearly visible dark border and text in their default state, as defined in the Design System.
        *   **1.9.3: Enhance Overall Contrast:** Increase the text contrast across the site where necessary to improve readability and visual impact.
