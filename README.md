## 3. Development Roadmap

*   **Phase 1 & 2:** Foundation, UI/UX, Authentication & Dashboard. **(âœ“ Completed)**

*   **Phase 3: The Negotiation Studio - The Engine (Current Focus)**
    *   **Goal:** To replace mock data with a live, intelligent AI engine using the latest technology.
    *   **Task 3.1: Setup Cloud Function & Secrets:**
        *   Initialize Firebase Cloud Functions (2nd Gen). Create an HTTP-callable function `analyzeNegotiation`.
        *   *Note for Human Operator:* The `GEMINI_API_KEY` will be set manually via the Google Cloud Console UI.
    *   **Task 3.2: Implement the AI Core Logic with Gemini 2.5 Flash:**
        *   Inside the Cloud Function, install `@google/generative-ai` and `langchain`.
        *   Using LangChain, create a chain that calls the **`gemini-2.5-flash-latest`** model.
        *   Engineer a master prompt that instructs Gemini to act as an expert coach and return a structured JSON object matching our frontend's needs.
    *   **Task 3.3: Connect Frontend to the Live AI Engine:**
        *   Update `NegotiatePage.jsx` to call the live `analyzeNegotiation` function.
        *   Implement professional loading (skeleton UI) and error states.
        *   Update `ResultsPage.jsx` to display the live AI-generated data, replacing all mock data.

*   **Phase 4: Advanced AI - Activating RAG & Web Search**
    *   *(Tasks to be defined)*
